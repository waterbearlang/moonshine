# TODO for Moonshine

Docs for peg.js: https://pegjs.org/documentation#installation-node-js

## Extending the Moonshine Language

- [ ] Parse literal sets
- [ ] Parse literal vectors
- [ ] Parse minimized dicts (key is name of variable)
- [ ] Allow assignment only in functions for temp values
- [ ] Allow definition of constants
- [ ] Rest and spread? (not urgent)
- [ ] Shortcuts for math expressions
- [ ] Figure out what to do about async
- [ ] Add details about performance? Later (i.e., big-O of functions)

## Runtime

- [ ] Map basic JavaScript to carry over
- [ ] Vectors
- [ ] Matrixes
- [ ] Sets
- [ ] Shapes (declarative drawing)
- [ ] Everything currently in Waterbear and issues

## Testing

- [ ] Need to write more examples. Lots more
- [ ] Get all the P5 demos working, for instance

## Editing

- [ ] Once the script is parsed, the parse tree is the source of all truth, as an immutable structure.
- [ ] Blocks are built from parse tree
- [ ] "Text" view is really just different custom elements being driving by the parse tree
